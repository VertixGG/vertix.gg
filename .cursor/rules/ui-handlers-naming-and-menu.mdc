- Name select handlers with the pattern `on<Action><Entity>Selected`.

- When a select initiates a wizard/flow, bind that select in the adapter and route to the first step.

- Exclude the initiating UI entity from adapters/components via `getExcludedElements` to avoid callback resolution on the origin entity.
